# Rhodium #

**Rhodium is a Python library for robust decision making (RDM).**  It also includes support for
multiobjective robust decision making (MORDM) and exploratory modelling.  Rhodium is still
under active development, but it is ready for use.

#### What is Robust Decision Making?

Robust Decision Making (RDM) is an analytic framework developed by Robert Lempert and his
collaborators at RAND Corporation that helps identify potential robust strategies for a
particular problem, characterize the vulnerabilities of such strategies, and evaluate
trade-offs among them [Lempert et al. (2006)].  Multiobjective Robust Decision Making (MORDM)
is an extension of RDM to account for problems with multiple competing performance objectives,
enabling the exploration of performance tradeoffs with respect to robustness
[Kasprzyk et al. (2013), Hadka et al. (2015)].  We encourage users to read these articles
to gain insight into these methods.
