# Rhodium

Rhodium is a Python library for robust decision making and exploratory
modeling.  We are currently actively developing Rhodium, along with its sister
libraries [Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) and
[PRIM](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/PRIM).  See our
[IPython Notebook](https://gist.github.com/dhadka/a8d7095c98130d8f73bc)
for a demonstration of the current capabilities.
